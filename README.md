TAWS - Together We Are Strong

Imagine a world, where everyone has an equal amount of money and noone is facing disadvanteges..

Aim of this currency is to allow each and everyone to have time to think about their life.

Disadvantege of our current system is:

As an employee:
- your income is restricted to a contract with your employer
- if you want to buy something more expensive and you don't have enough savings, you will have to take a loan and pay it off
- in order to get this credit, your bank wants a life insurrance contract or other securities, which you will also have to pay or provide
- you are forced to earn more and more because inflation is decreasing your income
- some marriages are destroyed by expectations to be rich and have a wonderful life as advertised by influences but due to restricted income, this expectation can hardly be met
- you are forced to create you own business in order to gain more money instead of getting payed well or take a second or third job
- due to high expectations you are not looking well after your health which could result in heart attacks, cancer or other stresscausing deseases
- due to high expectations you are forced to work in a business or in a job that you might not like
- your influence only counts for a short period if you protest and if media is in your favour
- you are being promised, that everything will change for the good but when the next big story is in the media, it will be most likely forgotten

As a rich:
- you can move your income into low-tax countries or offshore islands
- you can have a high impact on political decissions and mostly it is in your favour
- you can invest in businesses and/or financial bonds that could give you advantages in financial terms
- greedy companies exploit nature and human resource in favour of shareholders

As a poor/homeless:
- you are dependend on state or private organisation welfare
- you get promises by political party to vote for them but after the election, promises are mostly forgotten or are not held
- your vote seems not to count

Why are crypto currencyies not applicable for public purpose:
- Crypto currencies are not distributed equally accross the whole population
- One had to be an early adopter to start
- Crypto currencies can be traded with real currencies, thus giving rich people the advantage to invest and bet on crypto performance and manipulation

My conclusions: 
- Money is more worth than a human being 
- We serve the money not the money serves us
- Money is a regulatory to dictate human-being
- Current crypto currencies are not usefull for public purpose

THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE

How:
- Everyone is equal
- Everyone gets payed the same per hour worldwide (60 TWAS / hour)
- Everyone gets an equal amount of TWAS when registered (50 years * 12 months * 30 days * 7h * 60 TWAS = 7.560.000,- TWAS)
- Money is there to serve you not vice versa
- There are only anual price changes for every good
- Everyone payes the same amount of taxes per month worldwide to the country in which the person is then registered for living (to be defined)
- The taxes are being used to operate the community and country e.g. schools, health care, streets, fresh water supplies, public transport, ..
- Prices are calculated by amount of a good of a certain kind devided by amount of hours used by people to produce it plus the used material prices devided by duration broken down to months
- Financial advantages (short FA) and their companies are forbitten e.g. Gambling businesses, Banks, Stock market, Foundations, ..
- The money can not be exchanged in other currencies to be resistant against devaluations
- The money is not transferable neighter after death nor as a gift. The account of the dead person will be closed.
- Legacy is forbitten. If a property wants to be inherited, the property price has to be payed from the inheritant or inheritants to the state as a tax
- Couples who get divorced, have to legally pay what the one owes to the other
- Houseprises or property prices stay the same until a legitime investment has been done to improve or preserve the static
- Public (state/community) accounts and their financial transfers can be viewed by everyone
- TWAS can be printed and handed over as such for legal payments
- Many people previously working for financial institues now can use their intellectual resource to investigate and calculate outerspace effects thus bringing the human race even further
- Copmany owners need to fund their companies of a consortium of long term investors (can also be by their employees) with their ability to take part of the decission
- TWAS will implement a board of (TBD) members of the world of ordinary people. They can be exchanged by a public voting system. This board defines rules for this currency

Ground Rule:
- No use for religiouse representation
